# Console-Finances Project

This project highlights how my JavaScript code analyzes financial records of a company using the provided dataset. The analysis includes calculating the total number of months, net total amount of Profit/Losses, average change in Profit/Losses, and identifying the greatest increase and decrease in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

# Dataset

The financial dataset is an array of arrays, where each sub-array contains two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.
